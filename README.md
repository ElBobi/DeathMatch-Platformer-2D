# DeathMatch-Platformer-2D
DeathMatch Platformer 2D is my second Unity-made game, featuring 2 players playing on the same machine. The purpose of the game is the following: Player 1 needs to complete a level ( a course ) and Player 2 (The Powerful Terraforming God) is trying to stop him and prevent him from winning.
